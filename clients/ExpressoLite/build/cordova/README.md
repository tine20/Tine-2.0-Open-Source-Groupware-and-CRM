EXPRESSO LITE CORDOVA APP

This folder contains the files needed to build ExpressoLite Cordova Application. They are basically:
  - config.xml: holds cordova configuration to build ExpressoLite app
  - icons: self explanatory
  - cordova_app: contains the cordova project itself. This will be generated by the build script

To build the cordova app, please use build_cordova.sh. It is located in the 'build' folder.



PRE-REQUISITES:

Keep in mind that in order to build the cordova project you need to have the following tools installed on your computer:
  - Node.js (needed to install cordova)
  - Cordova
  - Java (needed by the Android SDK)
  - Android SDK
  - In some environments, Ant is also required (to install it use 'sudo apt-get install ant')



INSTALLING NODEJS AND CORDOVA

Before you can install Cordova, first you'll need to install Node.js. There are several ways to install it, but this seems to be the easiest way:

------------
#extracted from https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager
sudo apt-get install curl
curl --silent --location https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_0.12 | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install nodejs
------------

Once NodeJs is installed, installing Cordova is easy:

------------
sudo npm install -g cordova
------------


INSTALLING THE ANDROID SDK

Android SDK is needed to build the Android App with Cordova. To make it available, follow these steps:

1 - Make sure you have java JDK installed
2 - Download Android SDK from https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Other
3 - Extract it to a folder of your preference (i.e: /home/user/android)
4 - Add android/tools and android/platform-tools to your path. You may do this by adding the following line to your ~/.profile file:  accordingly)
---------
export PATH="$HOME/android/tools:$HOME/android/platform-tools:$PATH"
---------
5 - You may need to restart your linux user session for the changes to take effect. Run 'android -help' to check if it is installed correctly
6 - Run 'android sdk' to open the SDK Manager
7 - Wait for the tool to download the list of tools. Once the list is loaded, select the following options (DO NOT SELECT EVERYTHING ON THE LIST, it takes a VERY long time to download):
  - Android SDK Tools (the latest)
  - Android SDK Platform-tools (the latest)
  - Android SDK Build-tools (the latest)
  - Android 5.1.1 (API 22)
8 - Click in the button named 'Install 11 packages...' (on the bottom right corner)
9 - Accept all license terms (you may have to select them one by one)
10 - Wait for the download (you may go for a coffee, it takes quite a while)
