Here are the build tools to create a package of the ExpressoLite

REQUIREMENTS
- NodeJs
- UglifyJS
- CleanCss

INSTALLING NODEJS

In order to run the build script, you need to have NodeJS installed to run the JS and CSS minifiers
There are several ways to install NodeJs, but this seems to be the easiest way:

------------
#extracted from https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager
sudo apt-get install curl
curl --silent --location https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_0.12 | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install nodejs
------------

INSTALLING UGLIFYJS

Once NodeJs is installed, installing UglifyJs is simple (WARNING: do not forget the @1 at the end of the command line):

------------
sudo npm -g install uglify-js@1
------------


INSTALLING CLEANCSS

Once NodeJs is installed, installing CleanCss is straightforward:
------------
sudo npm -g install clean-css
------------
